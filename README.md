Parameter Efficient Finetuning of LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) for News Data

This project is to build a text classification model fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to categorize news articles into one of four categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech.
Dataset used
  - AG News Dataset
Constraints
  - Use the roBERT model as the base model
  - The model should have less than 1M parameters
